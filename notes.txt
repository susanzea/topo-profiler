```` what does this all mean? ```
Then, after setting up these routes, you'll have to change every frontend AJAX request to your API so that it goes through your server instead. 
The requests you're making on the frontend now, will instead be made on your server (app.js). Every aspect of the request, then, either needs to:

be hardcoded on your server â€“ such as parts of the url that never change, or

be sent from the frontend to the backend, in the form of a query string param, wildcard, or in the request body.
